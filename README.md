3. **Code Quality**: Ensure that code follows best practices, is well-commented, and is easy to understand.
4. **History and Versioning**: Use meaningful commit messages, and create branches for new features or updates.
5. **Testing**: Ensure that all features are properly tested before merging changes.
6. **Security**: Exclude sensitive information, such as tokens or user data, and configure `.gitignore` to prevent them from being committed.
